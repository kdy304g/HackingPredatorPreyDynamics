https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134%2FS000635091601019X.pdf </br>
This research paper validates the Lotka-Volterra Model by testing symmetry frequency distributions of deviations between the theoretical trajectories and the empirical datasets and presene or absence of serial correlation. According to the validation, Lotka-Volterra Model is suitable for describing empirical data.
